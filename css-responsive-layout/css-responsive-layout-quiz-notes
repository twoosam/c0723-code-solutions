## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
A point where the design of the content changes like when the screen is at least a certain amount of pixels wide the style will change.
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
Percentages will work for any page width while pixels is specific to a certain page.
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
Cascading order will have the smaller min-width over rule the styles of the larger min-width.
