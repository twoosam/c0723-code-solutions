## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function can make code dynamic so that it cna be written once to handle many situations.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  The function key word is used to create a new function followed by a name. Within paranthesis there can be zero or more parameters followed by curly braces starting the code block. Then there is a return statement before closing curly braces.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function must be called for the code within its code block to run. To call a function, use the function's name followed by parenthesis of comma separated arguments.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  Defining a function does not cause the code in its code block to be run. A function must be called for the code within its code block to run.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  When defining a function, we declare parameters and when calling a function, we pass it arguments.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Parameters are the placeholders and will hold the calue of the an argument when the code block is ran.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  The return statement causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program and prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
