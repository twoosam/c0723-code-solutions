## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a React component?
  React componenets are reusable bits of code that serve the same purpose as functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
- How do you define a component in React?
  Export default followed by funciton and name of the function uppercased so React knows its a component. Then just add markup of what you want the component to do.
- How is a component "rendered" (made visible on the browser page)?
  The markup inside the CustomButton function contains HTML, so it reads the button tags and whatever is inside it.
