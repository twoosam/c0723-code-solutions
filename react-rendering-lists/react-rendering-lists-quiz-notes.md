## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- When would we want to dynamically create a list of React components?
  When we have data that is similar to each other in an array or object, methods like map and filter can be used to render lists of components from them.
- Why is it important for React components to be data-driven?
  It allows for large amounts of data and files to be divided into smaller parts easily and utilizing them in multiple or different places.
- Where in the component code would a list of React components typically be built?
  After using the map method on the array, an arrow function calls for the li element.
- What `Array` method is commonly used to create a list of React components?
  The map method is commonly used to render lists of components from them.
- Why do components in a list need to have unique keys?
